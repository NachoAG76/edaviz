## The Problem

80% of the effort in Data Science projects is due to data understanding, transformation, and cleaning.
And of course, it all starts with data exploration. If you don't understand the data set, you cannot work with it.

However, the path to understanding your data is paved with numerous tedious tasks. You need to investigate the distribution of your columns, explore missing values, and check whether there are some useful patterns in your data. In most cases, we need to be cautious with our data, as there are always odd suprises to be found.

## The Solution

**edaviz** is a Python library which helps you to quickly understand and visualize your pandas data frames. It is most helpful during data exploration after you received a new data set. However, you can also use it during data cleaning and data transformation, during feature engineering, or during model evaluation - whenever you need to understand your data.

## The Features

- Quick exploration without coding but full flexibility of code (after all, you are working in a Jupyter environment)
- High interactivity and data drill down
- Finds the best features for predicting your target
- Explores predictive patterns between columns
- Automatically chooses visualizations based on data types
